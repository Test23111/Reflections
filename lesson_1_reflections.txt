How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    i knew what to expect and it showed to me where exactly were the modifications so this saved me time
	to scroll through thousands of lines of code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    learn from the mistakes i have made before 
	not having to bother rename every time i make a change
	easilly roll back to a previous stage

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    one of the pros is that every time you commit you are going to always have a working project 
	every commit is a logical change and is always finished one
	the cons are that you are not always going to save at the correct time and the data you were going to commit might get lost before the commit
	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because it would be annoying to save each file separately for one project even if there are no changes made to it 
	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    when i use git log i can see all the commits that have been made to the repository and the changes to them 
	also there is the id of each change which i can use with git diff 
	with git diff i can see the differences between 2 commits where each added line si marked in green and each removedl ine is in red 
	i can use git diff with the id of the first commit and then the id of the second one 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    becasue i can easily return my projects states before the bugs 
i can easily track the version in which the bugs are introduced and see what caused it or just checkout to previous version without the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i would like to make a new project and try using it and making some commits to my project!
